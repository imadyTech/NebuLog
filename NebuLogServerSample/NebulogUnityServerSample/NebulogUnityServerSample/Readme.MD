Making a log console by Unity!

It is yet at preliminary stage that the listview based on Unity UGUI has limited capability to accept logs. The FPS dropped quickly when log information flow in. And the formatter is not yet completed.
I am going to make this logger console a little bit fun in the future by adding some 3D game features.
Let look forward to it!
